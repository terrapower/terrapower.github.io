## ARMI Ecosystem Documentation

This repository exists to support a GitHub Pages for the documentation of all open-source TerraPower projects. For instance, at the time of this writing, this repo represents the GitHub repositories:

* armi
* armicontrib-dif3d
* dragon-plugin

The primary documentation pages will be for the bleeding-edge, latest-and-greatest version of each repository/package. But as important releases happen, we will also append the versioned, official releases of the documentation too. For instance:

* https://terrapower.github.io/releases/armi/v0.2.0/index.html
