Transmutation and decay reactions.
==================================

This plots some of the transmutation and decay pathways for the actinides and some light
nuclides using the burn chain definition that is included with ARMI. Note that many of
these reactions are shortcut for reactor analysis. For example, a U-238 capture goes
directly to NP-239 rather than first going to U-239. Some (n,2n) reactions quickly beta
decay, so the transmutation goes right to the product. For the decays, the arrow has been
adjusted in width based on the branching ratio. The transmutations are all constant since
their rates would depend on the neutron spectrum being modeled. This is mostly a demo of
more features of the :py:mod:`armi.nucDirectory` subpackage.

Users can input their own transmutation matrix or use this one.

A Bateman equation/matrix exponential solver is required to actually *solve* transmutation and
decay problems, which can be provided via a plugin.
