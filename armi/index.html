<p>The Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI<sup>®</sup>) is an open-source tool that
streamlines your nuclear reactor design/analysis needs by providing a
software <em>reactor at your fingertips</em> and a rich ecosystem of utilities working in concert.
It is made for and by professional reactor analysis teams and
is maintained by <a class="reference external" href="http://terrapower.com/">TerraPower LLC</a>, a nuclear technology
development company.</p>
<p>ARMI:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Provides a hub-and-spoke mechanism to standardize communication and coupling between
physics kernels and the specialist analysts who use them,</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitates the creation and execution of detailed models and complex analysis
methodologies,</p></li>
<li><p>Provides an ecosystem within which to rapidly and collaboratively build new analysis
and physics simulation capabilities, and</p></li>
<li><p>Provides useful utilities to assist in reactor development.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few demos of ARMI can be seen in the <a class="reference external" href="https://terrapower.github.io/armi/gallery/index.html">ARMI example gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Using ARMI plus a collection of ARMI-aware physics plugins, an engineering team can
perform a full analysis of a reactor system and then repeat the same level of analysis
with some changed input parameters for almost no additional cost. Even better, thousands
of perturbed cases can be executed in parallel on large computers, helping conceptual
design teams home in on an optimal design, or helping detailed design teams understand
sensitivities all the way from, for example, an impurity in a control material to the
peak structural temperature in a design-basis transient.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>ARMI does not come with a full selection of physics kernels. They will need to
be acquired or developed for your specific project in order to make full use of this
tool. Many of the example use-cases discussed in this manual require functionality
that is not included in the open-source ARMI Framework.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, ARMI aims to enhance the quality, ease, and rigor of computational nuclear
reactor design and analysis. Additional high-level overview about this system can be

<h2>Quick start<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Before starting, you need to have <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> 3.9+.</p>
<p>Get the ARMI code, install the prerequisites, and fire up the launcher with the following
commands. You probably want to do this in a virtual environment as described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://terrapower.github.io/armi/installation.html">Installation
documentation</a>. Otherwise, the
dependencies could conflict with your system dependencies.</p>
<p>First, upgrade your version of pip:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip install -U pip&gt;=22.1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now clone and install ARMI:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/terrapower/armi
$ cd armi
$ pip install -e .
$ armi --help
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ARMI tests are meant to be run using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/">pytest</a>
locally</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip install -e &quot;.[test]&quot;

<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Nuclear reactor design requires, among other things, answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where are the neutrons? How fast are they moving? In which direction?</p></li>
<li><p>How quickly are atomic nuclei splitting? How long until the fuel runs out? How many
atoms in the structure are being energetically displaced?</p></li>
<li><p>How much heat do these reactions produce? How quickly must coolant flow past the fuel
to maintain appropriate temperatures? What are the temperatures of the fuel, coolant,
and structure?</p></li>
<li><p>Can the structural arrangement support itself given the temperatures and pressures
induced by the flowing coolant? For how long?</p></li>
<li><p>If a pump loses power or a control rod accidentally withdraws, how quickly will the
chain reaction stop while keeping radiation contained?</p></li>
<li><p>How much used nuclear fuel is generated per useful energy produced? How long until it
decays to stability?</p></li>
<li><p>Where and when should we move the fuel to most economically maintain the chain
reaction?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the dose and activation above the head and in the secondary loop?</p></li>
<li><p>How does containment handle various postulated accidents?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the building handle earthquakes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Digital computers have assisted in nuclear technology development since the days of the
ENIAC in the 1940s. We now understand reactor physics well enough to build detailed
simulations, which can answer many of these design questions in a cost-effective, and
flexible manner. This allows us to simulate all kinds of different reactors with
different fuels, coolants, moderators, power levels, safety systems, and power cycles.
We can run our virtual reactors through the decades, tossing various off-normal
conditions at them now and then, to see how they perform in terms of capability,
economics, and safety.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Of course, experimental validation remains necessary for many new configurations and situations during licensing.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, some nuclear software written in the 1960s is still in use today
(mostly ported to Fortran 90 by now). These codes are validated against physical
experiments that no longer exist. Meanwhile, new cutting-edge nuclear software is being
developed today for powerful computers. Both old and new, these tools are often
challenging to operate and to use in concert with other sub-specialty codes that are
necessary to reach a full system analysis.</p>
<p>The ARMI approach was born out of this situation: how can we best leverage an eclectic
mix of legacy and modern tools with a small team to do full-scope analysis? We built an
environment that lets us automate the tedious, uncoupled, and error-prone parts of
reactor engineering/analysis work. We can turn around a very meaningful and detailed
core analysis given a major change (e.g. change power by 50%) in just a few weeks. We
can dispatch hundreds of parameter sweeps to multiple machines and then perform
multiobjective optimization on the resulting design space.</p>
<p>The ARMI system is largely written in the Python programming language. Its high-level
nature allows nuclear and mechanical engineers to rapidly automate their analysis tasks
from their sub-specialties. This helps eliminate the translation step between
computer-scientists and power plant design engineers. This allows good division of
labor: the computer scientists can focus on the overall performance and maintainability
of the framework, while the power plant engineers focus on power plant engineering.</p>
<p>We’ve spent 10 years developing this system in a reactor design context. We focused
primarily on what’s needed to do advanced reactor design and analysis.</p>
<p>Because of ARMI’s high-level nature, we believe we can collaborate effectively with all
ongoing reactor software developments.</p>

<section id="communication-and-coupling">
<h2>Communication and coupling<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-and-coupling" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ARMI provides a central place for all physics kernels to interact: the Reactor Model.
All modules read <em>state</em> information from this Reactor and write their output to it.
This common interface allows seamless communication and coupling between different
physics sub-specialties. If you plug one new physics kernel into ARMI, it becomes
coupled to N other kernels. The ARMI Framework, depicted in green below, is the majority
of the open source package. Several skeletal analysis routines are included as well to
perform basic data management and to help align efforts on external physics kernels.</p>

<section id="automation">
<h2>Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#automation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ARMI can quickly and easily produce complex input files with high levels of detail in
various approximations. This enables users to perform rapid high-fidelity analyses to
make sure all important physics are captured. It also enables sensitivity studies of
different modeling approximations (e.g. symmetries, transport vs. diffusion vs. Monte
Carlo, subchannel vs. CFD, etc.).</p>

<section id="new-analysis-and-physics-capabilities">
<h2>New analysis and physics capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#new-analysis-and-physics-capabilities" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The ARMI reactor model is fully accessible via a Python-based API, meaning that
power-users and developers have full access to the details of the plant at all times.
Developers adding new physics features can take advantage of the ARMI data management
structure by simply reading and writing to the Reactor state. Leveraging the
infrastructure of ARMI, progress can be made rapidly.</p>
<p>Power-user analysts can modify the plant in many ways. For instance, removing all sodium
coolant is a one-liner:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setNumberDensity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;NA23&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mf">0.0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and finding the peak power density is easy:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getMaxParam</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;pdens&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any ARMI state can be written out to whichever format the user desires, meaning that
nominally identical cases can be produced for multiple similar codes in sensitivity
studies. To read power densities, simply read them off the assembly objects. Instead of
producing spreadsheets and making plots manually, analysts may write scripts to generate
output reports that run automatically.</p>
<p>Writing a module within ARMI automatically features access to the ARMI API, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cross section processing</p></li>
<li><p>Material properties</p></li>
<li><p>Thermal expansion</p></li>
<li><p>Database persistence</p></li>
<li><p>Data visualization</p></li>
<li><p>A code testing, documentation, and version control system</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="use-cases">
<h2>Use cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Given input describing a reactor, a typical ARMI run loops over a set of plugins in a
certain sequence. Some plugins trigger third-party simulation codes, producing input
files for them, executing them, and translating the output back onto the reactor model
as state information. Other plugins perform physics simulations directly. A variety of
plugins are available from TerraPower LLC with certain licensing terms, and it is our
hope that a rich ecosystem of useful plugins will be developed and curated by the
community (university research teams, national labs, other companies, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, one ARMI sequence may involve the calculation of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>nuclear cross sections,</p></li>
<li><p>global flux and power,</p></li>
<li><p>subchannel temperatures,</p></li>
<li><p>duct wall pressures,</p></li>
<li><p>cladding strain and wastage,</p></li>
<li><p>fission gas pressure,</p></li>
<li><p>reactivity feedbacks (including from core mechanical),</p></li>
<li><p>flow orificing,</p></li>
<li><p>the equilibrium fuel cycle,</p></li>
<li><p>control rod worth,</p></li>
<li><p>shutdown margin,</p></li>
<li><p>frequency stability margins,</p></li>
<li><p>total levelized cost of electricity for the run,</p></li>
<li><p>and the peak cladding temperature in a variety of design and beyond-design basis
transients.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another sequence may simply compute the cost of feed uranium and enrichment in an
initial core and quit. The possibilities are limited only by our creativity.</p>
<p>These large runs may also be run through the multiobjective design optimization system,
which runs many cases with input perturbations to help find the best overall system,
considering all important physics at the same time.</p>
<p>Other interest may come from the following:</p>
<section id="the-research-scientist">
<h3>The Research Scientist<a class="headerlink" href="#the-research-scientist" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A nuclear reactor research scientist, whether at a national lab or on a graduate or
undergraduate university team, may benefit greatly from using ARMI. It’s not uncommon
for such people to spend significant fractions of effort on data management. ARMI will
handle the tedium so that researchers can better focus on designing and testing their
research.</p>
<p>For example, if an ARMI input file describing the FFTF reactor in detail is provided,
the researcher can start running benchmark cases with their new code method very
rapidly, rather than spending the time building their own FFTF model.</p>
<p>If someone wants to try varying nuclear cross sections by a percent here and there to
compute sensitivities, ARMI is a perfect platform upon which to operate.</p>
<p>If a reactor designer wants to try out a new Machine Learning algorithm for fuel
management, plugging it into ARMI and having it run on all the physics kernels of the
ARMI ecosystem will be a great way to prove its true value (note that this requires a
rich ARMI physics ecosystem).</p>

<h3>The Nuclear Startup Engineer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-nuclear-startup-engineer" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As various companies evaluate their ideas, they need tools for analysis. They
can pick up ARMI and save 10 years of development and hit the ground running by
plugging in their design-specific physics kernels and proprietary design
inputs. ARMI’s parameter sweep features, reactor model, and parallel utilities will
all come in handy immediately.</p>

<h3>The Enthusiast<a class="headerlink" href="#the-enthusiast" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If an enthusiast wants to try out a reactor idea they have, they can use ARMI

see if their idea has wings, and if it does, they can then find a way to bring
it to engineering and commercial reality.</p>

<section id="history-of-armi">
<h2>History of ARMI<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-armi" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ARMI was originally created by TerraPower, LLC near Seattle WA starting in 2009. Its
founding mission was to determine the optimal fuel management operations required to
transition a fresh Traveling Wave Reactor core from startup into an equilibrium state.
It started out automating the Argonne National Lab (ANL) fast reactor neutronics codes,
MC2 and REBUS. The reactor model design was made with the intention of adding other
physics capabilities later. Soon, simple thermal hydraulics were added and it’s grown
ever since. It has continuously evolved towards a general reactor analysis framework.</p>
<p>Following requests by outside parties to use ARMI, we started working on a more modular
architecture for ARMI, allowing some of the intertwined physics capabilities to be
separated out as plugins from the standalone framework.</p>
<p>The nuclear industry is small, and it faces many challenges. It also has a tradition of
secrecy. As a result, there is risk of overlapping work being done by other entities.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that collaborating on software systems can help align some efforts
worldwide, increasing quality and efficiency. In reactor development, the idea is
generally cheap. It’s the shakedown, technology and supply chain development,
engineering demo, and commercial demo that are the hard parts.</p>
<p>Thus, ARMI was released under an open-source license in 2019 to facilitate mutually
beneficial collaboration across the nuclear industry, where many teams are independently
developing similar reactor analysis/automation frameworks. TerraPower will make its
proprietary analysis routines, physics kernels, and material properties available under
commercial licenses.</p>
<p>We also hope that if more people can rapidly analyze the performance of their reactor
ideas, limited available funding can be spent more effectively.</p>

<p>Being largely written in the Python programming language, the ARMI system works on
basically any kind of computer. We have developed it predominantly within a Microsoft
Windows environment, but have performed tests under various flavors of Linux as well. It
can perform meaningful analysis on a single laptop, but the full value of design
optimization and large problems is realized with parallel runs over MPI with 32-128
CPUs, or more (requires installation optional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mpi4py</span></code> library).
Serious engineering models can consume significant RAM, so at least 16 GB
is recommended.</p>
<p>The original developer’s HPC environment has been Windows based, so some development is
needed to support the more traditional Linux HPC environments.</p>

<p>Due to TerraPower goals and priorities, many ARMI modules were developed with the
sodium-cooled TWR as the target, and are not necessarily yet optimized for other plants.
On the other hand, we have attempted to keep the framework general where possible, and
many modules are broadly applicable to many reactors. We have run parts of ARMI on
various SFRs (TWRs, FFTF, Joyo, Phenix), some fast critical assemblies (such as ZPPRs
and BFS), molten salt reactors, and some thermal systems. Support for the basic
needs of thermal reactors (like a good spatial description of pin maps) exists but
has not been subject to as much use.</p>
<p>ARMI was developed within a rapidly changing R&amp;D environment. It evolved accordingly,
and naturally carries some legacy. We continuously attempt to identify and update
problematic parts of the code. Users should understand that ARMI is not a polished
consumer software product, but rather a powerful and flexible engineering tool. It has
the potential to accelerate work on many kinds of reactors. But in many cases, it will
require serious and targeted investment.</p>
<p>ARMI was largely written by nuclear and mechanical engineers. We (as a whole) only
really, truly, recognized the value of things like static typing in a complex system
like ARMI somewhat recently.</p>
<p>ARMI has been written to support specific engineering/design tasks. As such, polish in
the GUIs and output is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>Most of our code is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">camelCase</span></code> style, which is not the normal style for
Python. This started in 2009 and we have stuck with the convention.</p>

<p>Be careful when including any dependency in ARMI (say in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code> file) not
to include anything with a license that superceeds our Apache license. For instance,
any third-party Python library included in ARMI with a GPL license will make the whole
project fall under the GPL license. But a lot of potential users of ARMI will want to
keep some of their work private, so we can’t allow any GPL dependencies.</p>
<p>For that reason, it is generally considered best-practice in the ARMI ecosystem to
only use third-party Python libraries that have MIT or BSD licenses.</p>
